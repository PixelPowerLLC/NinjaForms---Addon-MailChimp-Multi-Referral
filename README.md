# NinjaForms---Addon-MailChimp-Multi-Referral
Splits a Ninja Form submission with multiple referral contacts into individual MailChimp contacts

The initial intention of this project was to create an addon for NinjaForms. However, anyone who looks at the NinjaForms API and documentation for more then 15 minutes will realize how lacking the information actually is. If you continue and try to implement any of the examples you will find out that the code actually doesn't work.

After much pain a suffering I found some posts and documentation scattered on the internet from other devs experiencing the same problems and finally put together a solution that works.

The new purpose of this repo an attempt to share my working code and the resources that I found to be useful.
